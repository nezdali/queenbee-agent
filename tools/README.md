# `tools/`

This directory holds saved Queen Bee tools, plus a curated set of
pre-built ones that ship with the repo so you have working examples
out of the box.

Each tool is a pair of files:

```
tools/<name>.py     # async def run(context: dict) -> str
tools/<name>.json   # manifest: description, trigger_keywords, permission, status
```

## Pre-shipped tools

Grouped by topic. The **Auth** column lists required env vars
